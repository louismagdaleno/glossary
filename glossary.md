UI: User Interface; what the user interacts with

UX: User Experience; what the user experiences

HTML: Hypertext Markup Language; HTML elements and constructs, which exhibit inheritance, compose the structure of a document that can be rendered by a web browser. Ideally, presentational & semantic HTML are in harmonious balance.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (style sheet language); dictates presentation of structural components using a hierarchical cascade of style inputs.  

CSS Selector Specificity: *universal < elements < .classes, :pseudo-classes, \[attributes\] < #IDs < inline styles < !important

Box Model: Content ] Padding ] Border ] Margin

Flexbox: A CSS module that enables responsivity for spatial presentation of components

CLI: Command Line Interface

Git: Distributed version control system

Web Design Layouts: 
* Fixed: no change in layout size/design across screen dimensions
* Fluid: elements shrink + grow proportionally to screen dimension changes
* Adaptive: breakpoints change layout at select screen sizes
* Responsive: combination of fluid sizing + breakpoints for optimally dynamic web design

LESS: Dynamic preprocessor style sheet language that can be compiled to CSS

JavaScript Variable Declation:
* var: function scoped; mutable; allows variable redeclaration; depreciated
* let: block scoped; mutable; throws an error for duplicate declaration if you use same variable name twice; use for iterators & conditionals
* const: block scope; immutable

JavaScript Literals:
* const objectLiteral = { key: "value", type: "pairs" }
    * dot notation:      objectLiteral.key = "value"
    * bracket notation:  objectLiteral\["type"\] = "pairs"
* const stringLiteral = "I am a string"
* const arrayLiteral = [1, 2, 3, "abc"]
* const booleanLiteral = true
* const integerLiteral = -120
* const floatLiteral = 2.4
* const templateLiteral = \`The average American family has ${floatLiteral} kids.\`

Array Helper Methods:
* forEach
   * Accepts a function as a parameter and executes code against each element in the array. This replaces the standard "for"         loop when iterating over an entire array.
*map
   *Accepts a function as a parameter and executes code against each element in the array. Returns a new array of the same size     as the initial array.
* filter
   * Accepts a function as a parameter and executes code against each element in the array. Each element is evaluated against conditional logic implemented in the passed function. Returns a new array of items that passed the conditional test.
* find
   * Accepts a function as a parameter and executes code against each element in the array searching for a match. Finds the        first item that satisfies the conditional logic and returns it.
* every
   * Accepts a function as a parameter and each element is evaluated against conditional logic implemented in the passed function. Returns true or false depending on whether or not all elements in the array meet the conditional logic.
* some
   * Accepts a function as a parameter and each element is evaluated against conditional logic implemented in the passed function. Returns true  or false depending on whether or not some elements in the array meet the conditional logic.
* reduce
   * Accepts two parameters: a reducer function and an initial value. The reducer function itself accepts two parameters: an accumulator and a current value.  The reduce helper method will output a single value. 


Closures: The combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared; a construct of scope that gives functions access to data defined in outer functions.

Callbacks: Callback functions are passed as arguments to higher-order functions to be invoked after the execution of the higher-order function.

`this` keyword in JavaScript: Provides a generalized reference to that changes based on its context and binding.
* Window binding: in the global scope, the value of `this` will be the window/console Object.
* Implicit binding: when a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is what `this` will refer to.
* New binding: when a constructor function is used, `this` refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.
* Explicit binding: when JavaScriptâ€™s call or apply method is used, `this` is bound manually.

JavaScript `class`: syntactic sugar; special functions that return Objects; used in conjunction with `new` for instantiation.

DOM: Document Object Model; object representation of the html elements of a webpage;  takes the structure of a tree, with each html element being a node of the tree. DOM selectors include getElementById('id'), getElementByClassName('class'), querySelector('.class'), querySelectorAll('.class')

HTMLCollection & NodeList: array-like objects that are returned by DOM selectors. Both are zero-indexed with a length property; NodeLists has a forEach method.

Event Listeners: monitors for a specific type of event and dispatches a specified callback function when the event is detected.

JavaScript Component: a reusable unit of html, css, and javascript that improves the building process of elements with shared presentation and/or functionality.
